# **App Name**: Lilly Sprinklr Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Login Page: Replicate the login page with email field pre-filled with sherina@example.com and password field pre-filled with demo123. A 'Sign In' button that leads to the dashboard upon successful 'login'.
- Dashboard Columns: Create six scrollable columns: 'Assigned to Pace', 'All Demo - Awaiting', 'Demo - Mentions', 'All Assigned', 'All Awaiting response' (initially empty), and 'All closed'.
- Case Display: Display cases within the columns, showing the first few features as shown in the reference, with unique case IDs.
- Assign to Agent: Implement a button (person with a plus icon) on each case that, when clicked, opens a popup with a list of email IDs (including pace@zamp.ai). Clicking an email assigns the case to that email; assigning to Pace moves the case to the 'Assigned to Pace' column.
- Case Details View: When a case is opened, display a conversation view and a properties view side-by-side.
- Case Properties: Implement the top properties section in the case details view with functional dropdown lists for each property (highlighted in light blue in the reference). Upon selection, the chosen option should display cleanly.
